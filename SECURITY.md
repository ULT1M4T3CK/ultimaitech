# Security Guidelines for UltimAItech

## üîê Security Checklist

### Environment Variables
- [ ] Change default JWT secret in production
- [ ] Use strong, randomly generated secrets (use `crypto.randomBytes(64).toString('hex')`)
- [ ] Change default admin credentials
- [ ] Use environment-specific database credentials
- [ ] Never commit `.env` files to version control

### Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Implement strong password policies (minimum 8 characters)
- [ ] Use JWT tokens with appropriate expiration times
- [ ] Implement session timeout and refresh token mechanism
- [ ] Consider implementing 2FA for admin accounts
- [ ] Log all authentication attempts and admin actions

### Data Protection
- [ ] Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- [ ] Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- [ ] Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- [ ] Use HTTPS in production
- [ ] Implement CSRF protection for state-changing operations

### File Upload Security
- [ ] Validate file types and sizes
- [ ] Scan uploaded files for malware
- [ ] Store uploaded files outside web root
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for file uploads

### Database Security
- [ ] Use least privilege principle for database users
- [ ] Implement database connection encryption
- [ ] Regular database backups with encryption
- [ ] Monitor database access and queries

### Production Deployment
- [ ] Enable HTTPS with proper SSL/TLS certificates
- [ ] Use security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- [ ] Implement proper error handling (don't expose stack traces)
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting for security events
- [ ] Regular security updates and patches

## üö® Security Vulnerabilities Fixed

1. **Hardcoded Credentials**: Removed from environment example files
2. **Weak JWT Secrets**: Added guidance for strong secret generation
3. **Input Validation**: Enhanced form validation on client and server
4. **Security Headers**: Implemented CSP and other security headers
5. **Authentication**: Enhanced login validation and error handling

## üîß Security Configuration

### JWT Secret Generation
```bash
# Generate a strong JWT secret
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
```

### Environment Variables (Production)
```bash
# Use strong, unique values for production
JWT_SECRET=your_64_character_hex_secret_here
ADMIN_USERNAME=your_secure_admin_username
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_very_strong_password_123!
DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_database_password
```

### Rate Limiting Configuration
```javascript
// Current rate limiting (can be adjusted based on needs)
const authLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 5, // Limit each IP to 5 requests per windowMs
  message: 'Too many login attempts, please try again later.',
  standardHeaders: true,
  legacyHeaders: false,
});
```

## üìã Security Monitoring

### What to Monitor
- Failed login attempts
- Unusual API usage patterns
- File upload attempts
- Database query performance
- Error rates and types

### Recommended Tools
- Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
- Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- SSL/TLS monitoring
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

## üîÑ Regular Security Tasks

### Weekly
- [ ] Review access logs
- [ ] Check for failed login attempts
- [ ] Monitor error rates

### Monthly
- [ ] Update dependencies
- [ ] Review and rotate secrets
- [ ] Check SSL certificate expiration
- [ ] Audit user permissions

### Quarterly
- [ ] Security penetration testing
- [ ] Code security review
- [ ] Backup and recovery testing
- [ ] Security training updates

## üìû Incident Response

### In Case of Security Incident
1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Change all passwords and secrets
   - Review access logs
   - Document the incident

2. **Investigation**
   - Determine scope of breach
   - Identify attack vectors
   - Assess data impact
   - Preserve evidence

3. **Recovery**
   - Patch vulnerabilities
   - Restore from clean backups
   - Update security measures
   - Monitor for continued threats

4. **Post-Incident**
   - Conduct lessons learned review
   - Update security procedures
   - Improve monitoring
   - Communicate with stakeholders

**Remember**: Security is an ongoing process, not a one-time setup. Regular reviews and updates are essential.
